# fable-harness v1.1 (2026-07-04) -- Stop hook: block completion without a finish-gate marker.
# v1.1: FABLE_HARNESS_DISABLE kill switch (keys: stop, all).
# Blocks the stop (exit 2) when this session modified files (Write/Edit/MultiEdit/NotebookEdit)
# and no `[finish-gate: pass]` / `[finish-gate: n/a]` marker was printed after the last edit.
# Loop safety: honors stop_hook_active when present, and independently gives up after this
# hook has already blocked twice since the last edit. Fails open on any parsing problem.
# NOTE: keep this file ASCII-only -- Windows PowerShell 5.1 reads BOM-less scripts as ANSI.
